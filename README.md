# Steam Trace Files Cleaner
This is a rewritten Cleaner based off the one rave shared with me. This rewrite was necessary in order to get rid of crash factors he hasn't haved yet covered. All credits go to him though.

This, in theory, is supposed to get rid of all the commonly used files Steam uses to create a biased profile about you. This biased profile is one of the factors used to decide what trust factor (CS:GO) you will get when you log-into an account, already existing account, in my theory, are less heavy determined by this, than newly created accounts from the same PC. Means if you buy a green trust factor account, it shouldn't get a red trust factor, just because you use it on the same PC. But take this info with some salt, as I am not the brain behind this application.

What this cleaner doesn't do is clean your previously affected trust factor, as that's already written down somewhere on their server-side. It could help you though giving you a better trust factor when you create new accounts to play on. Even though all your previous accounts got banned on the same PC.

My comment on this would be that some pasted-together HWID Spoofer could come in favor for you.
